52 participants (39 females) took part in this study and their brain electrophysiological activity were being recorded using 64-channel EasyCap from Brain Products. After mounting the EEG electrode cap, the study protocol started with 5 minutes of closed-eyes rest (Pre-hypnosis Baseline), followed by four experimental conditions (Experimental Blocks), and ended with another 5 minutes of closed-eyes rest (Post-hypnosis Baseline). Throughout the four Experimental Blocks, participants were exposed to either conventional or unconventional (placebo) hypnotic inductions described either as hypnosis or as simple relaxation technique in a 2 x 2 balanced placebo design. In other words, each participant underwent four trials, in which they were exposed to a conventional hypnosis induction presented as “hypnosis”; a conventional hypnosis induction presented as “control”; an unconventional hypnosis induction presented as “hypnosis”; and an unconventional hypnosis induction presented as “control” in a randomized order.
